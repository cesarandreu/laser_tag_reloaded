#Laser Tag Reloaded

---

##What is this

This is a maple mini project that exclusively uses libmaple and pure C. Many functions are adapted or inspired from Leaflabs' Wirish libraries. 

---

###Examples

You can copy the code in any of the files inside the Tests folders and paste it into real-main.c. The run *make* and *make install*, this will build the example and install it on your Maple Mini. 

Not all functions have been tested. All files in the Tests folder are proven to work.
